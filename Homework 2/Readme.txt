So I had a lot of trouble with this one. Even before class, I figured out how to make a list of all of the
unique values and sum all of the trading volume for each one. However, I failed in every attempt to grab the 
first and last closing value for each ticker. I tried searching by date, I made a second counter to offset
against i (i.e. the thought was that i - count of entries would return the earliest closing value and i 
would be the last) but regardless of my effort, all of my yearly change values were incorrect. I have decided 
to give up due to a large amount of frustration, confusion, and lack of time or patience to figure out what I'm
doing wrong. It seems like a straightforward problem, but I guess there's something wrong with me in that I can't
get to it.
