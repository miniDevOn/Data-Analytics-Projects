# Julian Johnson's Data Analytics Projects

This repository contains all of the various projects I have and will undertake in my pursuit of becoming a Data Analyst. My projects, in order of most recent to least recent, are as follows:

# Machine Learning Projects:

## Support Vector Machines using the Iris Database:
For this project, I will be using the famous [Iris flower data set](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). 

The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis. 

The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.

## Decision Trees and Random Forests
For this project I will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). I will try to create a model that will help predict people who have a high probability of paying back investments. 

## Logistic Regression
In this project we will be working with a fake advertising data set, indicating whether or not a particular internet user clicked on an Advertisement. We will try to create a model that will predict whether or not they will click on an ad based off the features of that user.

## Linear Regression

# General Projects

## Belly Button Biodiversity Web App
Using Python, SQLAlchemy, JavaScript, and Flask, I've built an interactive web app which explores the Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/

## Intro to JavaScript
A first dive into JavaScript. A table is populated with data on UFO sightings.

## Mars Scraping - Mission to Mars
I've built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

## Github IO
Here, a Web Visualization Dashboard page is created using css and bootstrap, populated by data and visualizations created in the Python and APIs project (Latitude and Longitude data).

## Python and APIs
This analysis uses Python requests, APIs, and json traversals to utilize data's true power to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

## API Creation using Flask and SQL Alchemy
Using Python, Flask, and SQL Alchemy, I've created an API containing temperature and preciptation data from Honolulu, Hawaii.

## SQL Scripting
A thorough list of SQL queries using the sakila database.

## Social Analytics - Sentiment Analysis
Using Python and Vader, a sentiment analysis is performed using the tweets from popular news organizations, CNN, BBC, FOX, CBS, and the New York Times.
