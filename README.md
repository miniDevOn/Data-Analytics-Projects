This repository contains all of the various projects I have and will undertake in my pursuit of becoming a Data Analyst. My projects, in order of most recent to least recent, are as follows:

# Machine Learning Projects:

Using Python, SQLAlchemy, JavaScript, and Flask, I've built an interactive web app which explores the Belly Button Biodiversity Dataset: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/

## Intro to JavaScript
A first dive into JavaScript. A table is populated with data on UFO sightings.

## Mars Scraping - Mission to Mars
I've built a web application that scrapes various websites for data related to the Mission to Mars and displays the information in a single HTML page.

## Github IO
Here, a Web Visualization Dashboard page is created using css and bootstrap, populated by data and visualizations created in the Python and APIs project (Latitude and Longitude data).

## Python and APIs
This analysis uses Python requests, APIs, and json traversals to utilize data's true power to answer a fundamental question: "What's the weather like as we approach the equator?"

## API Creation using Flask and SQL Alchemy
Using Python, Flask, and SQL Alchemy, I've created an API containing temperature and preciptation data from Honolulu, Hawaii.

A thorough list of SQL queries using the sakila database.
