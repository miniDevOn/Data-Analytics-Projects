# Earthquake Mapping with Leaflet.js:
The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, and this visualization attempts to convey their data in a meaningful way.
